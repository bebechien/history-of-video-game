## 1. Summary

**Pong** is a two-player electronic simulation of table tennis. Players compete by controlling vertical paddles on opposite sides of the screen to deflect a moving ball back and forth. The objective is to force the opponent to miss the ball, thereby earning a point. The game combines reflex-based gameplay with simple physics to create an addictive, competitive loop.

## 2. Gameplay Overview

### 2.1 Objective

The primary goal is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game is played until one player reaches a specific score limit (e.g., 11 or 15 points) or strictly for high-score retention in early iterations.

### 2.2 Game Flow

1. **Attract Mode:** The game displays a demo of the AI playing against itself to entice players.
2. **Start:** Player inserts a coin. The score resets to `0 - 0`.
3. **Serve:** The ball spawns in the center of the screen and moves toward one player.
4. **Rally:** Players deflect the ball. The ball speed increases as the rally continues.
5. **Score:** If a player misses, the opponent gains a point. The ball resets to the center.
6. **Game Over:** When the win condition is met, the game freezes or resets to Attract Mode.

## 3. Game Mechanics

### 3.1 Paddle Controls

* **Movement:** Players control a vertical paddle (rectangle).
* **Axis:** Movement is restricted to the **Y-axis** (Up/Down) only.
* **Boundaries:** Paddles cannot move beyond the top or bottom edges of the screen.
* **Input Sensitivity:** The rotary dial allows for variable speed—turning the knob quickly moves the paddle quickly.

### 3.2 The Ball & Physics

* **Movement:** The ball (square pixel) moves in a straight line until it collides with an object.
* **Wall Collision:**
* **Top/Bottom Walls:** The ball bounces off at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (standard reflection).
* **Left/Right Edges:** If the ball passes the paddle and hits the left or right screen edge, a point is awarded to the opposing player.

* **Paddle Collision (The "English" Mechanic):**
* The angle of reflection is determined by **where** the ball hits the paddle.
* **Center Hit:** The ball reflects horizontally (0° relative to the x-axis).
* **Edge Hit:** The ball reflects at a sharper angle (up to ~45°) depending on how far from the center it hits.

* **Speed Acceleration:**
* The ball slightly increases in speed after a specific number of paddle hits in a single rally.
* The ball resets to base speed after a point is scored.

### 3.3 Scoring

* **Display:** Two large digital numbers at the top of the screen (one for Player 1, one for Player 2).
* **Trigger:** When the ball passes a paddle's X-axis coordinate.
* **Feedback:** A distinct sound plays, and the game pauses briefly before the next serve.

## 4. Visual Assets & Art Style

### 4.1 Style Guide

* **Palette:** Monochrome (White objects on a Black background).
* **Resolution:** Low-resolution raster scan.
* **Aesthetic:** Minimalist, functional, high-contrast.

### 4.2 Asset List

| Asset Name | Description | Dimensions (approx) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Paddle** | A solid white vertical rectangle. | 2% Width x 10% Height |
| **Ball** | A single solid white square. | 2% Width x 2% Height |
| **Net** | A dashed vertical line down the center of the screen. | 1px Width (Dashed) |
| **Score Font** | Large, blocky numeric segmented digits. | Large Header |
| **Play Field** | Pure black void. | Full Screen |

## 5. Audio Design

*Pong* utilizes a minimalist soundscape generated by the hardware. There are only three distinct sounds:

1. **Paddle Hit:** A short, high-pitched "beep" when the ball strikes a paddle.
2. **Wall Hit:** A lower-pitched "boop" when the ball strikes the top or bottom wall.
3. **Score:** A distinct, longer, or dissonant "buzz" or chime when a point is scored (ball misses paddle).

## 6. User Interface (UI)

The UI is entirely diegetic (integrated into the playfield). There are no menus, health bars, or maps.

* **The Net:** Visually divides the screen into Player 1 (Left) and Player 2 (Right) territories.
* **The Scoreboard:** Permanently fixed at the top center of the screen, acting as the only HUD element.

## 7. Technical Constraints (Original Hardware)

* **Logic:** Hardwired logic circuits (No CPU or code in the very first prototype; later versions used microchips).
* **Display:** Standard Television set mechanism.
* **Memory:** None (State is held in current circuit status).
